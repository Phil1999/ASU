                <hr>
                <h3> Welcome to Ingraham ASU </h3>
                <p> Welcome to Ingraham Asian Student Union! ASU is a student led club built upon cultural, community, and leadership values on a basis geared towards supporting Asian youth at Ingraham, and the general Asian community in Seattle. Discussions on issues/challenges facing Asian youth today; cultural informationals; community service projects; and club participation in a wide variety of events in Seattle showcasing Asian culture, are the heart of what ASU is all about this year! Meetings are every Monday at lunch in RM 101 (French RM)! </p>
                <br>
                <p> Asian Student Union returns to Ingraham this year, for the first time in over ten years. In this time, the demographic landscape of our school has shifted heavily with the rise in popularity of the Ib program. The population of caucasian students in IB classrooms has risen dramatically, to accompany the steady decline of a gathered minority presence is worrying for our school. A stagnation of ethnic diversity in the IB program has changed how Ingraham looks today. General ED and IB have never looked so different as they do today. At the heart of it Asian Youth are present, but not united or supported in a purpose for which they can impact their community. As a club we are committed to actively advocating on behalf of the voice Asian people at Ingraham; as well a building a platform for which to give our members a hand in building strong relationships with their community through the Asian culture. I want Ingraham to be prime example for other high schools all across Seattle, for what the values of leadership, community, and culture can do for our city. </p>
